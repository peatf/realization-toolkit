    title: "Power Positioning Timeline Jump",
    tip: "This was a big part of the recent Timebending Series I offered and is all about aligning you with your inner authority and power. Real creative power—the ability to allow your intentions to materialize—only exists in the present moment and is most accessible when you're open. But often, judgment about where you are in your business or career can close you off from this power and pull you out of the present. Judgment is constantly around us, fueled by messaging that makes us feel like we need to either run away from something or chase after something desperately. Reconnecting to your authority doesn't have to be a long or complicated process; it can happen whenever you're ready. If you're looking for support in making that shift, take 45 minutes for yourself, get comfortable, and do the Power Positioning Timeline Jump."

    title: "Abundance Cheat Codes",
    tip: "Unlocking abundance isn't about chasing it, but about shifting your reality to let it flow naturally. The \"codes\" aren't magic tricks or anything like that, they're a shift in how you relate to money, sales, and business. When you integrate them, you start to see how abundance is already woven into your life. No more hustling for it. It just clicks.\nWhat happens when you start applying these?\nMoney Comes Easier: You'll see your income grow without grinding yourself down. Money aligns with the true value you bring, and it flows in ways that feel natural.\nEffortless Attraction: Clients show up, not because you're pushing, but because they're drawn to you and what you offer. Sales stop being something you \"close\" and start being part of the natural rhythm.\nMoney Confidence: Fear, scarcity: those get quieter. You start operating from a place of security, knowing that money is there to support you, not stress you. You can focus on what matters.\nBusiness Feels Like You: Your business stops being a grind and feels more like an extension of who you are. Pricing, offers, growth, it all gets clearer, more aligned. You start making moves that feel true to you, not forced.\nComfort with More: Earning more starts feeling like your new baseline. You'll get used to living in that higher financial energy, and with that comfort comes the confidence to say yes to bigger opportunities.\nThis isn't a gimmick. It's a deeper transformation of how you experience business and abundance. When you're ready to let money and success feel like second nature, these codes will guide you there."
