Like what an insanely gorgeous way to get feedback from virtual Pea… the way my goal and desire was summarized set me up for my next steps perfectly. When I took that summary and applied it to creating content? I am so high on life right now and just so happy to do what I'm doing that nothing else really matters. What a fun way to create and execute a project!!! Thanks PEA! <3",

    text: "I wasn't in a good mood before going through the prompts because I was thinking about how burnt out I felt and feeling victim to not being able to do things that would counter the exhaustion. Then I took accountability for how burnt I've been feeling and remembered I haven't been sleeping as early as I know I could to at least feel rested instead of tired, and now I'm set to get a good amount of sleep before the work week. Yay me! Then after going through the prompts, my mood completely shifted. I'm feeling so much better, intentional, and hella supported. :) Really appreciative for these daily prompts.",

It felt difficult to allow the sensation of hearing the feedback I don't want and than redirecting the energy of avoiding that - something just klicked. Of course later that day I get the exact feedback that I would love to hear. Thank you Pea <3",

'work' doesn't feel like the right word so i'm going to switch in 'play while being simultaneously resourced'. feeling like a benevolent sorcerer.",

MUCH! and feeling so inspired to keep going in this direction, then posting the images on social media the other day and getting more likes than any other post in, like, years.

If you would ask me 2 years ago how I would be able to live the abundant life I'm living now, I would tell you I'd have to be on the cusp of burn-out, working many hours and feeling the pressure in order to be successful. I'm so happy that my pov has changed completely, and that I'm feeling like I have the time in the world and I'm just having fun. It doesn't need to be hard at all, I love the ease and flow and my slow morning :) I love to delegate stuff I don't like doing. I love to work on my projects more intuitively, not as rigidly planned. In many ways I get more done than ever, while just chilling haha. Bliiss!!",

    text: "I have a daily celebrations journal that I write it every morning, but it's fun to share here too and share the energiezzz. Celebrating having created a career where I can literally drop everything if I want to or when I want to and the money will continue to come in like clockwork while I take all the time I need to tend to my feels and the things (as is currently the case with a family members illness). When I'm not feelin' it, I don't have to be feelin' it, and that is absolute dream come true. That is so normal for me that I forget how freaking amazing it actually is. So this morning while I was feeling frustrated with lack of progress in one area, I remembered the fact that the reality I am currently living was once something I could not imagine would ever be possible for me. I have literally no pressure on me (except from myself sometimes) even though I am the source of the monies for our household, and that is totally and utterly amazing, I did that!! By simply choosing it and staying with myself on it until it was here. Which reminds me the other stuff will be exactly the same.",

Had a great chat with the Refiner the other day and it gave me great insight, my mindset changed and I feel soooo relaxed now, the worke i've done has been really fun and easy, and the sales have also gone up. That has given me more time to be with my family, friends, pets, my garden and pour into other creations I had on hold. Now I'm excited to see what else I can create from this amazing place of trust, fun and relaxation. Amazing.",

I don't believe these instances are mutually exclusive :) I'm collecting the evidence that a) I can trust myself and where I'm going and b) what I need is already available to me, I just need to allow it in.

This has manifested in moving my body more, getting out of the house more, connecting with others, being open more, and being willing to speak and externalize from my desired identity and reality. Celebrating not punishing myself as harshly for the moments when I don't do any of those things. I like where I'm at right now, and that's cool.",

I want to celebrate the fact that I'm finally choosing my well-being and health ABOVE money and the (awful) put-others-first-before-myself kind of responsibility I've always upheld when it comes to work, especially if I'm passionate about it. This action feels good, even if it's kind of new to me. But anyway, to celebrate, comfort and reward myself, I decided to take up the generous BF offer for the RTK membership! Heheheh. I am happy to be back again; I am committing to believing and relaxing for at least a month! P.S. Funnily enough another artist local in my area has just reached out to me out of the blue asking me to model, and is offering to pay more than the money I 'lost' from this morning!

One single payment received with neutrality. Last night $15k hit my bank account which really is life changing. I feel thrilled but also calm, the payment was for exactly $15,000 which to me felt like reality winking at me - - that feels like an easy number. Right now my career really does feel like a game.",

    text: "I'm new to the clurb, and have found that we are indeed all fam-there is such a coherence to this space that over the weekend I did not one, but both timeline jumps in the Power Tools Kit. It just felt right. I felt ready, and I knew the New Moon was bringing it all to me. My desire was to embody my most successful self. Not because I needed anything from her, necessarily, but because I wanted to get to know her better and let her drive for a change. For the first time since doing the timeline jumps (been in the practice for over a year), I actually felt myself meet ME. The self that I was hugging was ME. I've never felt it that personally before, it's always felt a bit external. But because of that shift, the way I feel, the words I say internally & externally, the choices I make, and how I respond to the world around me are different than before, but in no way does doing the new thing feel foreign. It feels warm and cozy and cheery, and also like I'm remembering something I've always done, not trying so hard to learn a new behavior. I feel like I've welcomed myself Home. Thanks Pea! Thanks friends!",

YAY to my big ass money plant that keeps growing. All the random intuitive investments I made that have all grown this year. My cute cat. My sweet office. My new computer, and spacious time and schedule to just re-lax and en-JOY. Thank you pea and thank you juicy artistic peers!",

Great cannabis moment w bf, laughter, deep talk, great sex, dancing at the supermarket to where is the love by black eyed peas. Buying glass pearls/marbles and colourful glue sticks just for fun and decorating the candle holders w the marbles. Making instagram stories just for fund and how it comes to me feeling a little cringe but doing it anyways. Doing less \"productive stuff\". Taking a long walk without phone in the forest and admiring the beauty of the moss, the trees, the light, the greens. Drinking two milky coffees bc I like it.

    text: "Appreciating the sensation of wholeness as something i've known in my mind for a while drops down into my body as wisdom… aah. The moment when mind + body + heart finally agree is like finding a clear frequency sans static. I'd been feeling tension the past 3 weeks over a fear of repeating tired old patterns this winter season & wanting to change a bit of my sales process to make it easier & allow me more rest this season. This brought up guilt, feelings of inadequacy/\"not-enoughness,\" judgements of being lazy, and fear of failure. This showed up as tightness on my neck shoulders and upper back. I see my mind consumed with figuring out a guarantee, my body getting stressed, and my heart just wanting to take it a day at a time. Yesterday I decided I no longer want to use my mind to metabolize this tension so I got a targeted upper body massage. Eight hours of sleep later, it clicked: The version of me that I've been wanting isn't figuring out sufficiency this winter because she already has it. It's automatically given no matter the state of my energy, whether it's high or low. There are customers for every level I'm willing and able to give. Pea says this, I knew it in my mind, but today my body and heart aligned and accepted it as truth. I also got some material proof by the way of 2 new bookings using the easier sales process. :-) Now, instead of prayers to move bookings my way (with a bit of a desperate energy in hindsight), I am writing a note of thanks for what's here, which is truly more than enough.",

And then I celebrate last nights writing urge, six texts in one setting and no sleep until 3 am, but feeling calm about it, telling my body its safe and believing it, acknowledging the threats and the angst but giving it the balm of authority and agency. I celebrate following the inspiration to make a little winter popup in instagram w my printed shirts and selling almost everything in 1.5 days after asking for money portals. Celebrating a friend who called a day to tell me he joins us for new years eve in the mountains, celebrating myself for being able to organize a thing w 8 people for five days in the alps for the start of a new year. A sensation in my body that grows and magnifies everyday of trust and everything is going to be alright, you're safe, you're enough.

A dear old friend has published her memoir and is on the cover of the ny times book review. I have truly never been drawn to her celebrity or notoriety but instead of her high standard for fund and life, and her curiosity for all the different ways life can be outside of humdrum societal thinking. Secondly, one of my favorite underground theater artists wants to meet this week and collaborate on a video for their next show which will surely be fab. Finally I was recording at a studio and the owner/operator is hilarious but also deeply knowledgeable about music of course, and I was eating up the insights they were sharing about music and specific recording practices.",
